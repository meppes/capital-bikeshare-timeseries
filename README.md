# Capital Bikeshare Time Series

## Project Members:

* __Marissa Eppes__
* __Kyle Hayes__

## Goal: 

__Develop and deploy a Seasonal ARIMA time series model capable of forecasting Capital Bikeshare bicycle rentals over the next 12 months__

## Files in Repository:

    * __technical_notebook.ipynb__ - step-by-step walk through of the modeling/optimization process with rationale explaining decisions made. This notebook starts by exploring stationarity, ACFs, and PACFs for the data. From here, many models are tested and compared against one another, and a 12-month forecast is made using the best model. The notebook then repeats the process for data broken down according to member vs. casual rentals.
